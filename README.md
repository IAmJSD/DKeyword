# DKeyword
ðŸ¤š - An easy way to pick up upon, respond to or block keywords in Discord.

This is more or less a rewritten version of my old Theresa May selfbot. It's a lot more streamlined, cleaner and better in every way than the former.

### Setup
Download the files for the bot and make sure Python 3.6+ is installed.
After this, simply install the following dependencies:
- discord.py

To complete the setup, open the bot file in an IDE or text editor and input your token, desired banned words and desired words to respond to.
You can enable and disable these two features at ease.
